IMPORT AND SEGMENT T1 MRI WITH BRAINVISA IN NEUROSPIN
(wrote by baptiste)

Tip : similar but more general information are available on http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/Tutorials/SegBrainVisa

1) Open the Konsole and type "cd /neurospin/meg/meg_rep/anat".

2) Type "brainvisa" to run this software.
	check BrainVISA => Préférences.
	click on the green icon "DataBase" : select /neurospin/meg/meg_rep/anat/brainvisa_segmentation.

3) Click on "gestion des données" =>  "client de récupération des données".
	You can access these data by clicking on the small cross on the left of "Siemens Tim Trio 3.0T(Neurospin).
	All the acquisitions are sorted by date, subject and session.
	Give the output folder and the format to convert and launch.

4) Use these successive command lines to put your images into the proper orientation 	
	VipFlip –i sequencename.ima –o sequencename_flip1.ima –m yz
	VipFlip –i sequencename_flip1.ima –o sequencename_flip2.ima –m xy
	VipFlip –i sequencename_flip2.ima –o sequencename_flip3.ima –m xx
	The slices in 'sequencename_flip3.ima' are in the proper orientation: right is on the right. 

5) In "Gestion des données", open the folder "IRM T1" => Double click on "importation d'une IRM T1".
	Input: sequencename_flip3.ima .
	Output: /neurospin/meg/meg_rep/anat/brainvisa_segmentation.
	Data type: raw T1 MRI .
	File format: GIS .
	Protocol: segmentation .
	Sujet: enter subject name (the NIP number).
	Then click on "exécuter".

6) In "IRM T1", Open the folder "Pipeline de Segmentation" => Double click on "Pipeline T1 2007".
7) click on "Pipeline T1 2007" on the left window
	Select all operations excepted "Graphe des plis corticaux" and "Sulci recognition" (you don't need it). 

8) Then input processing parameters
	Mri: open your original MRI file (no flip) by clicking on the red icon and selecting your subject.
	Mri_corrected: should be selected by default.
	Normalized : no (should be selected by default).
	Anterior_Commissure : click on the button on the right of AC input, it willopen the software
	Anatomist wich allows you to define AC. => left click on saggital and axial view (left window),
	then drag and drop the subject MRI to these empty view on the right window : you can select your AC
	by clicking again on the icon on the right of AC input.
Tip : how to define these reference points is explained here : http://neuroimage.usc.edu/brainstorm/CoordinateSystems
	Do the same thing for the other anatomical points : PC, IP and LHP
	Be carefull!!! In Anatomist: if you chose the Preference "Radiologic view" the right (left) hemisphere is on the left (right).
	The Preference "Neurologic view" displays the right hemisphere on the right.
Tip : T1 MRI acquired in neurospin have a Vitamine A capsule on the right side as a marker to check left/right orientation issue
	Then click on "exécuter"

9) After these operations, you will have the following files in the folder : database_anat/YourProtocol/YourSubject/t1mri/default_acquisition/default_analysis/segmentation/mesh
		SubjectName_head.mesh
		SubjectName_Lhemi.mesh
		SubjectName_Rhemi.mesh
		SubjectName_Lwhite.mesh
		SubjectName_Rwhite.mesh
as well as the corresponding files with minf extension

10) Then you can check the goodness of the results in "Afficheur" => "Anatomist voir hémisphère avec l'IRM"
	Select your hemi-mesh
	Then click on "exécuter", it will open anatomist
	Click on "3D" in the left window and drag and drop the surface input ("objets") on the surface output ("fenetres")
	you can rotate by pressing the middle button and move the mouse
Tip : all the control of Anatomist are available by putting mouse selector on small icons in the left of visualization windows
